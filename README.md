# gpt-web-client

This project is a web-based chat application that utilizes technologies such as TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Hono web framework, and OpenAI's GPT for generating chat responses and titles. It supports creating chat rooms, sending messages within those rooms, and dynamically generating room titles based on the chat content.

This is only a sample application and should never be used for production purposes.

## Usage
